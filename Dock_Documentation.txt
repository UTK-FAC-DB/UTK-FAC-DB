This document is to note the process of how I, Chase Brunette-Pak, had
set up the docker for hosting both the facdb database and backend
for the site.

1. Sign into the machine

    - If signing in from a remote machine (Ensure you have a profile on the
      server)

        * From linux based machine:

          "ssh username@com1642.eecs.utk.edu"

    - Signing in locally

      (Need documentation)

2. Install Docker on Arch Linux

    - Luckily docker is popular enough to have official set up for Arch
      you can follow the steps on (https://linuxhint.com/docker_arch_linux/),
      if not I'll list them below

      A. Make sure the system is up to date

        " sudo pacman -Syu "

      B. Enable loop modue

        " sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/loop.conf <<< "loop" "

        " modprobe loop "
