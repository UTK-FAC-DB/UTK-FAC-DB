        "MedicalHistory_Other": "From document \"skeletal anomalies\"\r\n1.  The decedent had what may be a gene switching error in which though born with normal skeleto-musculature, from approximately 1 year to age 8, tendons and ligaments grew at a slower rate than bones, more so in lower extremities, as if trying to \"grow club feet.\"  This was mal-treated through orthopaedic intervention involving casts and braces, rather than surgical repair.  The improper treatment was sufficient for selective service medical disqualification, small enough to allow for an active life that included working in law enforcement, but any activity requiing foot-based balance such as s skating or skiing was impossible.\r\n\r\nNet effect on skeleton may be noticeable, and offer a \"puzzle valeu\" as an eeercise: tarsals and meta-tarsals may possibly suggest an odd gait that might be an identifier using partial remains.\r\n\r\n2.  Phalanges, ring and little, both hands.  1961,2.  Repeated fractures from rugby.\r\n\r\n3.  Dislocated sternum, 1965.  Trampoline accident caused hyper-extension (back of head showed bruises from being hit by heels) causing ribs to separate from sternum.  Medically treated by binding. \r\n\r\n4.  LEft tibia apx. 2cm from distal end:  1968.  Unset fracture from motorcycle accident.  \"Road rash\" macerations prevented plaster casting for 5 days, at which point X-ray showed knitting begun.  Accentuated bd gait.  \r\n\r\n5.  LEft ribs, 8-10, fractured above kidney:  1975.  Run over by vehicle.  Damage to abdominal muscles accelerated process of lordosis.\r\n\r\n6.  Left and right ribs, 6-10, diagnosed as \"bruised\" 1985.  Motorcycle accident.\r\n\r\n7.  L3-5, S1 1990-92.  Trauma, lordosis, disc bulge, bone spurs diagnosed by X-ray, cat scan and emg during periods of treatment for hand-to-hand law enforcement traumas.\r\n\r\nOrganic History\r\n1.  Fasciculation, 1986 fwd, increasing until treated.  Self-diagnosis of chronic magnesium deficiency was confirmed by primary care provider, and control/disappearance with heavy magnesium supplementation.  Provider's opinion was that abdominal damage from 1975 accident had resolved as difficulty absorbing/processing \"white metals\"\r\n\r\nKidney stones:  1992.  Decedant was unaware of the stones until blockage of the ureters caused pulsing pressure, pain, etc in kidnesy.  The urologist's opinion was that the nature of the stones, with concurrent history of gall sotnes indicated problems with calcium/magnesium chemistries.  He ascribed the absense of pain in situ to nerve impairment, L5-S1.  Arkansas' workman's comp neurosurgeon ascribed it to pre-existing idiopathic neuropathy.\r\n\r\nGall stones, 1994-2003.  Decedent had regular incidents of glal stones passing, with accompanying fever, pain, etc.  In February 2003, decedent was found fevered and incoherent on residence floor and was involuntarily transported to hospital where ultrasound and blood work identified acute gall bladder with sepsis.  Four days in hospital treatment for sepsis; laparoscopic removal of gall bladder day 5.  Discharge day 6.  ",
